#Compiler project
A compiler for the Cool (Classroom Object-Oriented Language) language implemented in C++.
[Cool reference manual](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/software/cool/cool-manual.pdf)
The Cool compiler project consists of 4 programming assignments that each cover a phase of the compilation process:

1. lexical analyzer implemented with flex
2. parser implemented with yacc
3. semantic analyzer, type checker and type inferer
4. assembly code generator for a MIPS architecture

The four individual compiler parts can be combined to obtain a fully working compiler for Cool.
